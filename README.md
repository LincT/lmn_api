# Live Music Notes, Opinions and Pictures - API
## lmn_api is a spin-off application from https://github.com/LincT/lmn

This MCTC Capstone Project 5 is an API with the following functionality:

* Get local Artists, Venues, and Shows musical events data via a webscrapping technique
* Create JSON files for each table type (e.g. artist, venue, etc.) and load into database
* Listen for API calls from lmn project (via HTTP Restful call, see above link) to return requested data
* Note: webscrapping will be done on a schedule performed by a cron job
